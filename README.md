# New York Times Subscription Renewal

This is a small script that uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) to automate the renewal of a New York Times subscription using a library card.

The script does the following:

- Navigates to the library's website
- Clicks on the New York Times link
- Logs in with the library card
- Logs in with the New York Times account
- Renews the subscription
